    "A Terry Stop, also known as an \"Investigative Detention\" or \"Stop and Frisk,\" allows law enforcement officers to temporarily detain a person for investigation when they reasonably suspect involvement in criminal activity. This stop is used when there is insufficient evidence for an arrest (i.e., no probable cause) but enough suspicion to justify a brief investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose is to either confirm or dispel the officer's suspicions. If during the stop, probable cause for an arrest arises, the suspect is arrested. If no probable cause is found, the suspect is released.\n",

    "Terry stops can disrupt the normal lives of individuals, especially when no arrests are made. During these stops, police officers may spend valuable time that could otherwise be used to address crime in other areas. Additionally, Terry stops initiated through 911 calls can lead to a waste of resources, particularly when they result in no arrests. These stops have also been plagued by concerns of racial profiling, with many individuals believing that the stops are disproportionately based on their race or gender. This has eroded the public’s perception of law enforcement and diminished the confidence they have in the police.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Terry stops are beneficial in preventing potential crimes, a more balanced approach is needed. To aid in this, a model has been developed to predict whether a Terry stop will result in an arrest. Given that Terry stops can be initiated through various channels such as 911 calls, messages, alarms, and police interactions, this model can help schedule calls appropriately and allocate resources more efficiently"
